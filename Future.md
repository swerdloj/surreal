# Extended Goals
1. Procedural Macro for View Creation (custom syntax)
2. QML-style markup language
3. Boostrapped Designer (like Android Studio)


# 1.0 Release
- Identify the minimum viable product


# Goals
1. Ease of use
  - See what people will do with the library
  - Make those features easy to use/simple
2. Performance
3. Customizability


# White Paper
- Can do in HTML
  - Website format (look into GitHub sites)
  - Look into format like https://bevyengine.org/community/
    - https://pages.github.com/
    - Can use custom domain at some point
  - Should show future potential
    - Encourage contributions
- First build basic feature set
- Consider video companion

## Purpose
- Introduce the project
  - What it solves
  - What it does
  - Why this over alternatives
- Specify intentions
- Relate to community (Rust & GUI development)
- Cross-platform & future-proof

## Implementation
- Explain how it accomplishes its various goals
- How it can/will grow


## Features
- Track animation state
  - Stop rendering when no new frames are needed


## Benchmarking
- Time per frame
- Note performance
  - Compare to Rust libraries
    - Bevy, Conrad, Iced, etc.
  - Compare to existing solution
    - Unity, Electron, etc.
  - Integrated GPU vs discrete
- CPU vs GPU frame times
- Compare to software rendering
  - Low powered devices such as Raspberry Pi
